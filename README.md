# SMARC Network: Smart Monitoring, Alarming, and Reporting of Air Quality in Critical Areas

This project aims to develop a low-cost sensor network to monitor air quality in the areas surrounding Cerro Patac√≥n, Panama. Conducted at the Technological University of Panama (UTP), the SMARC Network provides real-time data visualization in graphs for both government and private institutions, supporting enhanced environmental monitoring and rapid response.

This project utilizes LoRa technology.

## Parts Used

The following components are utilized in the SMARC MK1:

- **ESP32**: Microcontroller for processing and connectivity.
- **Laser-Based Particle Sensor SDS011**: Measures PM2.5 and PM10 particle concentration.
- **Pressure and Temperature Sensor AM2301 (DHT22)**: Provides temperature and humidity readings.
- **Battery and Solar Charger Controller**: Ensures efficient energy management.
- **LiFePO4 Battery**: Powers the system with stable and long-lasting energy storage.
- **Waterproof Sealed Project Box**: Protects the components from environmental factors.

## Deployment

The initial deployment of the **SMARC Network** took place at a designated location within the **Technological University of Panama (UTP)**. This site provided reliable internet access and an optimal environment for experimenting with **LoRa communication**.

### Deployment Phases

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The system was installed to test the **battery life** and evaluate the performance of the **solar charge controller**. 
   - It was determined that the initial charge controller was not functioning properly, and it was replaced with a generic **PWM solar charge controller** featuring a **5V USB output**. This output powers the **ESP32** and the connected sensors.

2. **Power System**:
   - A **10W solar panel** was utilized to charge a **LiFePO4 battery**, providing sustainable and stable energy for the system's operation.
   - The solar panel, in conjunction with the PWM charge controller, ensures continuous energy supply, even in outdoor conditions.

3. **Sensor Integration**:
   - After stabilizing the power system, the measurement systems were installed incrementally.
   - The **SDS011 Laser-Based Particle Sensor** was the last component to be integrated. This sensor includes a built-in fan to draw air for particulate measurement.

4. **Adaptations for Outdoor Deployment**:
   - To accommodate the particle sensor within the **hermetically sealed project box**:
     - A **tube** was connected to the sensor to allow external air intake. This tube is concealed beneath the solar panel to protect it from environmental elements like rain and dirt.
     - A **ventilation hole** was added beneath the box to regulate internal pressure and ensure adequate air circulation.
   - These modifications enable the sensor to draw fresh air while maintaining the weatherproof integrity of the enclosure.
